# Moving Average Trading Strategy

A Moving average is a widely used signal in stock trading, which is loading average price over a defined number of days. Random fluctuations are very common in stock price. Taking an average price in a period can smooth out noise. It is sought to be good to find the trend. For example, we want to calculate the moving average of close price over three days, which is the average of Close price of today, yesterday, and the day before yesterday.

Moving Average of short period is more closely associated with recent change of stock price, which we call Fast Signal. Moving Average over long period reflects the price change over long-term history, which we call slow signal. We create MA10 and MA50, which are fast signal and slow signal respectively. Then, we plot close price MA10 and MA50. If MA10 is larger than MA50, the stock price is believed by some traders, that it goes up in the next several days. Otherwise, the price will decrease. Our strategy is, if MA10 is larger than MA50, we will buy and hold one share of stock.
